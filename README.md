# Programming Languages: Web Scraping & Exploratory Data Analysis

## Description
This project demonstrates web scraping, data cleaning, and visualization skills. I scraped a web page containing programming languages, their average salaries, and learning difficulty, then analyzed and visualized the dataset.

## Tools Used
- Python
- BeautifulSoup
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset
Data scraped from [Popular Programming Languages](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DA0321EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/datasets/Programming_Languages.html)

## How to Run
Open `Programming_Languages.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially.

## Key Findings
- Swift is the highest-paying language, while PHP and SQL are lower-paid.
- Python, Java, and JavaScript are easy to learn and high-paying, making them great choices for beginners.
